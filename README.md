# Library-Management

A library management system created using Python, SQL, and Notepad is a software application designed to automate and streamline the management of a library's operations. The system allows librarians to efficiently manage books, patrons, borrowing records, and other related tasks. Python is used as the programming language to develop the core functionality of the system. SQL is utilized to create and manage the database that stores information such as book details, patron information, and borrowing records. Notepad is employed as a text editor for writing and modifying code.

The library management system offers features such as book cataloging, tracking available copies, managing borrower details, issuing and returning books, generating reports, and managing overdue fines. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) where librarians can perform these tasks easily and effectively.

With the help of Python, SQL, and Notepad, the library management system helps librarians efficiently organize and manage library resources, simplifying the process of book circulation and enhancing the overall library experience for both staff and patrons.
